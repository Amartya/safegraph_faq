# SafeGraph COVID-19 Data Consortium #
SafeGraph is providing free access to our various datasets to help researchers, non-profits, and governments around the world with response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus). So far, 1,000+ organizations like the CDC are already in the consortium and are using SafeGraph and partner company datasets at no-cost. The data includes aggregated and anonymized datasets on social distancing and foot traffic to businesses. More details on the datasets here.

We are also enlisting the help of builders of any kind - engineers, data scientists, product managers, analysts - to assist teams that need help in creating insights on top of these datasets.
