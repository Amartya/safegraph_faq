Having trouble getting the data from aws s3 using the command line interface in your terminal?  

Please consider using  CloudBerry MSP360 Explorer (free) software. It  provides a user-interface to sync SafeGraph data on aws s3 to your local computer, all with clicks of a button. Here are specific instructions to use [CloudBerry Explorer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R-EvZEWPATwH67hXyrczAK16dpCoJnOuMm4WeXUuQFI/edit?usp=sharing).  

And friendly reminder: if you  only need a specific portion of the data in geography or in time, consider downloading your data from one of our partner platforms:
