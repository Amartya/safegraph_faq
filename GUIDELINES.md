# Community Guidelines & Best Practices #

## Communication Etiquette ##
- Fill out your display name as First_Name Last_Name (Organization/Affiliation). If you are not representing an organization or affiliation put (Self). This helps people find you and remember you.
- Please fill out your profile to include the following info: 
  - Area of Interest (5 words or less), 
  - Favorite data tools (e.g. python, STATA, excel)
  - Personal website
- Post your questions in public channels so everyone can learn together: 
  - Questions about SafeGraph data → [#safegraphdata](https://safegraphcovid19.slack.com/archives/C0109NPA543)
  - Questions about AWS, AWS CLI, or problems downloading data → [#aws-troubleshooting](https://safegraphcovid19.slack.com/archives/C0114D7SJCF)
  - Questions about other non-SafeGraph datasets → [#datasets](https://safegraphcovid19.slack.com/archives/C0129PCEAKB)
  - Questions about technical issues → [#icanhelp](https://safegraphcovid19.slack.com/archives/C010W1T8NF2), [#tools](https://safegraphcovid19.slack.com/archives/C0115PHMGM6), or other specialty channels like [#safegraph_in_stata](https://safegraphcovid19.slack.com/archives/C011WTUUQLB)
Do not send private messages unless there is a specific reason the information cannot or should not be shared with the community. Examples: reporting abuse. 
- Please use threads and respond in threads when possible to help organize discussion. 
- Please do not post in #announcements or use @channel or @here. These actions are reserved for Community moderators to help maintain clear communication when needed.

## Data Consortium Code of Conduct ##
This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the SafeGraph-managed community, Data Consortium, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.
The SafeGraph Data Consortium strives to:
- Be friendly and patient: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- Be welcoming: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Be respectful: We are a worldwide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language.
  - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”). This includes publicly disclosing information that was shared privately or in confidence by another community member.
  - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
  - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
- Understand disagreements: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
- This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Scope ##
This code of conduct applies to communities managed by SafeGraph. 
The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the community. 
Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, 
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Reporting Code of Conduct Issues ##
We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. 
This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. 
In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report 
your concerns by contacting consortium@safegraph.com. Your report will be promptly handled 
by a member of the SafeGraph team.

In your report please include:  
- Your contact information.
- Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

All reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. 
The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.  

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.  

This code of conduct is based on the template established by the [TODO Group](http://todogroup.org/) and used by numerous other large communities (e.g., [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/), [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/pages/876921332402685/open-source-code-of-conduct), 
[Twitter](), [GitHub]() and the Scope section from the [Contributor Covenant version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)).
